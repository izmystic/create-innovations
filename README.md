**mc-modpack-kit** is a GitHub Actions workflow template designed to simplify the release process of Minecraft modpacks using a structured monorepo approach. It automates essential tasks such as versioning, modpack building, and publishing on platforms like Modrinth and CurseForge. 

It also includes an `nix flake` for you fellow nix enjoyers! The actions also use it!

### Key Features

1. **Monorepo Structure**

   Embrace the power of organization with a monorepo-style architecture. Each subdirectory represents a different modpack version or loader type, streamlining your management of multiple modpack variations within a single repository.

   Example subdirectories:
   - `fabric/`: Fabric loader version.
   - `forge/`: Forge loader version.

   You can create more just by initializing packwiz in the said directory of your choosing.

2. **Automated Releases**

   Experience effortless version control with Release Please, which generates changelogs and handles version releases automatically, in sync with your pull requests. Maintain clarity with Conventional Commit Messages.

   Examples:
    - `feat(modpack/<mod>): <description>` for adding new features, configurations or content.
    - `chore(modpack/<mod>): <description>` for routine maintenance tasks or cleanups.
    - `update(modpack/<mod>): update <mod>` for updating mods to newer versions.
    - `mod(modpack/<mod>): add <mod>` for introducing new mods to the modpack.
       
4. **Mod Updates**

   Update your mods effortlessly by utilizing the `update.yml` workflow located in `.github/workflows/update.yml`. This action efficiently updates all mods across all subdirectories.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Set Up Secrets and Permissions**

   - Navigate to "Settings" -> "Secrets" and add the following secrets:
     - `MODRINTH_TOKEN`, `MODRINTH_ID` for Modrinth authentication.
     - `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN`, `CURSEFORGE_ID` for CurseForge authentication.
   - Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" under "Settings" -> "Actions" -> "General" -> "Workflow permissions".

3. **Initialize Your Modpack**

   - Generate a `pack.toml` file using `packwiz` (installation instructions [here](https://packwiz.infra.link/installation/)) within a modpack folder.
   - Begin by running `packwiz init`, preferably within the `main` directory.
  
4. **Set a release channel**
   - By default this template uses the `beta (0.1.0)` channel, you can switch it to `release (1.0.0)` when you are ready!
   - This can be done via executing `.github/workflows/bump-version-release.yml`!

5. **You are good to go!**
   - You can now merge the release PR that release please has made, sit back and enjoy a cup of coffee! ‚òï ^-^
